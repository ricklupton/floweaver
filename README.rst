Many kinds of data can be thought of as 'flows': energy and materials moving
through industry, money flowing through the economy, telephone lines moving
between providers, voters moving between parties. **floWeaver** helps you to
exchange and analyse flow data and visualise it using `Sankey diagrams
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram>`_.

For example, here is some data on flows of fruit from farms to customers:

.. image:: docs/demo_table.png

With floWeaver you can **visualise** this as a variety of **Sankey diagrams**
depending on what you want to show:

.. image:: docs/demo_animation/demo.gif

Although there are a variety of tools for working with flow data and Sankey
diagrams in particular contexts, there are no open data formats for sharing data
between tools and domains. We aim to provide a **common data format and data converters** 
to support interoperability and open data.

Get started using floWeaver
---------------------------

floWeaver is a Python package, but you can successfully use it as a data analysis
tool even without too much familiarity with Python. The best way to get started is
to use it in a `Jupyter notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_ (although it is just a Python
package, so you are free to use it however you wish).

üöÄ **Try floWeaver online with no installation:** `Quickstart tutorial
<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ricklupton/floweaver/master?filepath=docs%2Ftutorials%2Fquickstart.ipynb>`_.

To install floWeaver locally, you need Python 3 installed (you might want to install it 
using `Anaconda or Miniconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_); see the `installation page
<https://floweaver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ for full details.

Install floweaver using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install floweaver

You likely also want the `ipywidgets <http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_install.html>`_
and `ipysankeywidget <https://github.com/ricklupton/ipysankeywidget>`_ packages to show Sankey
diagrams in the Jupyter notebook. Install this using pip and enable:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install ipysankeywidget
   jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipysankeywidget
   
ipywidgets also needs to be enabled. You might have already done this, but missing it out is a
common cause of problems so it doesn't hurt to do it again!

.. code-block:: console

   jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension

To get started, open the `quickstart tutorial <docs/tutorials/quickstart.ipynb>`_ in
Jupyter notebook and step through the notebook cells to produce the fruit example shown above.

Contributing üéÅ
---------------

Thanks for your interest in contributing! There are many ways to contribute to floWeaver: 
sharing examples of work done using it, suggestions for improving the documentation, examples
of things that are more difficult than they should be or don't work, as well as actual fixes to
code and documentation. To get started see `CONTRIBUTING.md <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ and our `code of
conduct <CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.

We have a `detailed Roadmap <https://github.com/ricklupton/floweaver/projects/2>`_ showing what we
are working on up to May 2018; beyond that there is the `longer-term Roadmap <https://github.com/ricklupton/floweaver/projects/1>`_. We also have `good first issues grouped by type of contribution <https://github.com/ricklupton/floweaver/projects/3>`_.

How does it work?
-----------------

floWeaver builds on the approach described in the paper `Hybrid Sankey diagrams:
Visual analysis of multidimensional data for understanding resource use
<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.05.002>`_. It uses `ipysankeywidget 
<https://github.com/ricklupton/ipysankeywidget>`_ and `d3-sankey-diagram 
<https://github.com/ricklupton/d3-sankey-diagram>`_ for actually drawing the Sankey
diagrams.
